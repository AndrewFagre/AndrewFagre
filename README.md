Hi, I'm Andrew Fagre. 

I have over 16 years of experience as a Java Applications Developer.

I possess experience in Object-Oriented programming, Back-End design, J2EE, as well as database design and implementation.

I can independently set up servers for deploying web applications without relying on third-party tools. 

I have also planned and developed several enterprise applications, utilizing a JDBC over DAO pattern and ORM frameworks, specifically Hibernate.

I effectively communicate with team members at all levels, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical members.

I have been recognized for my ability to triage code, mentor junior developers, and for my thoroughness, never being satisfied with just getting the job done.

I'm excited to leverage my skills and experience to identify performance and reliability issues, ensuring a better customer experience.
