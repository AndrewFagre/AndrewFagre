Hello I am Andrew Fagre.
I have over 16 years experience as a Java Applications Developer.
I have experience with Object Oriented programming, Back End design, J2EE, as well as Database design and implementation.
I have set up servers for deploying Web applications without the use of third party tools. I have also planned and developed several Enterprise Applications.
I am able to effectively communicate with several levels of team members, successfully bridging the gap between technical and non technical members.
I have been recognized for my ability to triage code, mentoring junior developers, as well as for my thoroughness by never being satisfied with just getting the job done.
I am excited to use my skills and background to help identify performance and reliability issues, ensuring a better experience for the customer.
